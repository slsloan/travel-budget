## Project Description

### Overview

For project three we were tasked at building an app using MERN stack. We decided on a travel budgetting app that allowed the user to create a profile that they could add new trips to.

```
AS A traveler with a limited budget
I WANT to be able to track the trips I got on
SO THAT I can keep things organized
```
